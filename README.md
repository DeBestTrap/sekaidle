# sekaidle
This is a discord bot that is based on [teuteuf](https://github.com/teuteuf)'s Worldle.

## Features
Type in ]cn into a discord channel and it will start a game of sekaidle!
- The bot will send an image of a country and you have six tries to guess the name.
- If you guess wrong, the bot will say how far your guess was to the image's country.
- If you type in an invalid country, the bot will suggest a list of 5 country's with similar names to your guess.
